	<p>By now most people are aware of various cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Even if you do not actively follow the various cryptocurrencies, you still likely have heard of NFTs. They have gained popularity over the course of the last year and even made their way into mainstream media with shows like South Park. With the rise in interest surrounding NFT’s many people find themselves wondering “What is an NFT?”. This post aims to clear up some of the confusion surrounding this emerging trend by discussing the history, current usage and potential for future usages surrounding NFTs.
	</p><p>I would like to start this post off by giving some background information on what cryptocurrency is and how the blockchain and network operate together to enable digital currency. A blockchain is a digital ledger existing on a network working to confirm transactions in a block. Each set of transactions is added to a block. That block, once confirmed by the various nodes running the underlying software on the network, will add the confirmed block of transactions to the existing chain, creating… wait for it… a blockchain, hence the name. These transactions originally were intended for tracking the exchange of tokens. Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other tokens are what we commonly refer to as cryptocurrency.  These tokens can be traded with other users on the blockchain or exchanged for fiat currency using an exchange. Digital asset transfer is the basic functionality the blockchain enables.
	</p><p>Originally, Bitcoin was a single coin operating within its own network and blockchain, however since then many new networks have been created implementing new features. Nowadays, each network has its own native token and blockchain, for example the ETH token on the Ethereum network. New features have been added to different networks allowing for the deployment of “Smart Contracts” which enables a developer to create their own coin to operate within a network using the native token to facilitate transactional interactions with the smart contracts. Smart contracts are small chunks of code that can interact with each other on the blockchain. It may seem like a lot but essentially each network uses a blockchain. Most networks have support for deployment of smart contracts which when used, execute a small piece of code, and logs the transaction to the blockchain. Now, instead of only being able to trade the ETH token on the Ethereum network you can trade any number of coins supported by and deployed on the network. 
	</p><p>Now let’s discuss NFTs. According to Dean Sam at the Los Angeles Times ” A non-fungible token (NFT) is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded.” Smart contracts traditionally have been used to create coins which can be traded on the network. These coins can easily be exchanged for one another. A NFT is different in a few keyways. First, a smart contract used for tokens allows the creation of many tokens which can be bought, sold, or traded. A smart contract for an NFT is only a single token. This token cannot be exchanged for other tokens directly. NFTs are bought and sold using an application, like an exchange, where the native network coin is exchanged for the ownership of an NFT. Secondly, a NFT doesn’t typically do anything. Like a smart contract token, a NFT is deployed to the network. NFT’s are generally bytecode for a digital representation of something. They are not meant to be interacted with in the same manner as the coins created when deploying a smart contract. Imagine a digital picture. You could deploy that pictures’ digital representation to the network and record it on the blockchain. It doesn’t do anything besides exist. Finally, the NFT holds no value beyond what someone thinks it may be worth. Coins can at least be traded easily but most cryptocurrencies and even the US dollar, is not backed up by anything such as gold. Their worth depends solely on the value someone else would be willing to pay for it. Lastly, NFTs are unique. There is nothing unique about a particular coin on from a smart contract, however, NFTs are deployed in a singular manner meaning there is only one original, although nothing stops a copycat form deploying an exact copy but based on the uniqueness and timestamp from the blockchain we can confirm the original from copycat interpretations. 
	</p><p>Here is a simple way to think of NFTs. NFTs are like a digital piece of art. In fact, the very first ever NFT was called “monetized graphics” by the first minter Kevin McCoy and Anil Dash. Monetary value of art can range anywhere from 0 to priceless but their value is only determined solely by what someone is willing to pay. I cannot take the Mona Lisa down to the gas station and buy an Iced tea with it directly. I would first have to find someone who is willing to exchange my art for their fiat currency which I can then exchange for an Iced Tea.
	</p><p>Remember when I said South Park made an episode with NFTs in it? The entirety of the skit surrounding NFTs built on the idea they are essentially a Ponzi scheme. There is no value in owning one beyond what someone else might be willing to pay. In a recent article by Scott Reyburn of the New York Times, the current NFT craze was liken to that of Tulip Mania in the 1600’s. Eventually someone will not want your NFT, and it is now worthless. The current usage of popular NFTs will not live beyond its speculative time. 
	</p><p>So why are they making such large ripples in the cryptocurrency sphere? NFTs do have potential but not in the way they are currently being used.  Imagine you buy a car, and it comes with a variation of an NFT uniquely identifying your specific car. This NFT can implement some of the functionality of a coin smart contract allowing people to interact with it. Now imagine, every time you get gas, change your oil, or have any accident or repair done, a transaction is logged on the network for your NFT. Now, this unique identifier representing your car can keep track of its entire history. Transactions on the blockchain are never removed so you could easily see the history of everything ever logged for your car. Then when you go to sell it, a buyer could check its history in a guaranteed manner. If the operation was recorded to the blockchain it can never be modified. Then if the buyer buys the car, they can take over ownership of the NFT with this process continuing until the car no longer exists. This is just one example, but many others exist. Solutions for password-less authentication and many others have been proposed and are in active development. 
	</p><p>I hope this helps to make things a bit clearer. We discussed background on what the blockchain and network it operates on is. Next, we discussed what makes NFTs different from other fungible tokens and highlighted some key differences. We then talked about their monetary value. Finally, we spoke about what the future holds for this type of contract deployed on the blockchain. I hope you enjoyed this blog topic and that it cleared up some of the confusion surrounding this emerging trend.

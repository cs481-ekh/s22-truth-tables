## Abstract

Instructors and students working with truth tables are often subjected to creating tables that all have a similar
structure and contain the same or similar contents. This process can be repetitive, tedious, and unnecessary, so
some automation could be used to generate a base portion of the table dependent on the statements/clauses
provided.

The idea is to have an application that allows instructors to create truth table problems such as testing an
argument's validity, or finding out whether two propositional well-formed formulas (WFF) are equivalent, or
finding out whether a WFF is a tautology, etc..

We plan to build a Spring Boot application (Java based web framework), storing information in a MySQL
Database and using Boise State services for back-end/hosting. This will allow us to create truth table problems,
allowing the professor to organize different questions in chapters, and potentially evaluate student problems for
class grades.

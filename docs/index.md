GitHub Page

Each team must produce a web page hosted on their GitHub repo (using GitHub Pages). This is a static html page that gives a high-level overview of the project. The intended audience is employers who want to see examples of your work and other developers who may want to fork your project and/or contribute.

You should use a GitHub template or create your own style so the web page looks like more than a simple text README document.

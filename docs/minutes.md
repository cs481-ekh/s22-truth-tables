Action Items: Trevor, Zach, and Berto - begin working on/researching tasks. Kyle and Josh - Create tasks to add to board

**Sprint goal: By the end of this sprint, we should have the user interfaces complete for all pages of the application. Additionally, we should have some more advanced parser functionality. This means the ability to parse and separate a problem into sub groups based on the operators it contains. We should also have most of the error handling complete for all the input fields for a user. Lastly, we expect an admin user to be able to add/delete questions and chapters.**

**Sprint goal: At the end of this sprint, we aim to have the basic layout and styling complete for the main page as well as the 'sandbox' page. Additionally, the input field should be properly reading in the question so that its information can be parsed for the front end to work with. At the end of this sprint, we should also have the first implementation of our parser which will be able to detect operators to give front-end more flexibility.**
